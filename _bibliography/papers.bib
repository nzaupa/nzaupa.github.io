We consider both the continuous-time and the discrete-time case, and we provide conditions that do not require any assumption on the graph and ensure the uniform global exponential stability of the closed attractor that corresponds to the synchronization set, with guaranteed convergence rate.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of synchronizing a multiagent system (MAS) composed of several identical linear systems connected through a directed graph. To design a suitable controller, we construct conditions based on Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (BMIs) that ensure state synchronization. Since these conditions are non-convex, we propose an iterative algorithm based on a suitable relaxation that allows us to formulate Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) conditions. As a result, the algorithm yields a common static state-feedback matrix for the controller that satisfies general linear performance constraints. Our results are achieved under the mild assumption that the graph is time-invariant and connected.},
