I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in a short-term contract in the [MAC team](https://www.laas.fr/en/teams/mac/) at LAAS–CNRS (Toulouse, France) working with [Sophie  Tarbouriech](https://homepages.laas.fr/tarbour/bio.html) and [Samuele Zoboli](https://samuelezoboli.github.io/).
I am working on coding LMIs in Python using cvxpy to insert an ETM in a neural network.

I completed my Ph.D. in the [MAC team](https://www.laas.fr/en/teams/mac/) at LAAS–CNRS under the supervision of [Isabelle Queinnec](https://homepages.laas.fr/queinnec/) and [Luca Zaccarian](https://homepages.laas.fr/lzaccari/).
My thesis topic was revolving around the control of resonant converters. You can find an under-construction website [here](https://nzaupa.github.io/FPGA_resonant_converter/intro.html). The experimental part of this work is done in collaboration with [Carlos Olalla](https://usuaris.tinet.cat/com.ea/) and [Luis Martínez-Salamero](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=71pwBGoAAAAJ) at the Power Electronics laboratory of the [GAEI group](http://sauron.etse.urv.es/gaei/index.html) of Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV) in Tarragona, Spain.
During the thesis, I entered also in an ongoing work about the synchronization of identical linear multiagent systems in collaboration with [Giulia Giordano](http://giordanogiulia.altervista.org/) and [Sophie  Tarbouriech](https://homepages.laas.fr/tarbour/bio.html).

I received the master's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Trento, Italy, in 2021, following the bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering in 2018 in the [Department of Industrial Engineering](https://www.dii.unitn.it/en). 
It was during my master thesis where I contact Luca and proposed to me to collaborate on a project on resonant converter in Spain.
Before that, I was enrolled at [I.T.I.S. Rossi](https://www.itisrossi.edu.it/) (_Istituto Tecnico Industriale Statale_ in Italian) in Vicenza – a technical public high school – with the specialization in Electric-Electronics-Automation. I like to mention this since it is where all my passion for electronics and DIY burst out, and I had the possibility and time to submerge myself into it.


My main research interests include everything that is related to (industrial) engineering applications.
To name a few: mechatronics, power electronics, electronics, robotics, ...
I like to tackle challenging problems from different point of views, test solutions on real prototype to go beyond simulation, and dive into implementation's problems (which are always there to wait for us).
