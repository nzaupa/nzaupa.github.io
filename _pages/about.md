I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [MODUS team](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/equipe/modus) at [GIPSA-lab](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr) (Grenoble, France), working with [Bogdan Robu](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~bogdan.robu/) and [Matteo Tacchi](https://matteotacchi.wordpress.com/) on the ANR project [RADYAL](https://project.inria.fr/radyal/), focusing on energy-aware control for neural network optimization.
Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [MAC team](https://www.laas.fr/en/teams/mac/) at [LAAS–CNRS](https://www.laas.fr/en), working with [Sophie Tarbouriech](https://homepages.laas.fr/tarbour/bio.html) and [Samuele Zoboli](https://samuelezoboli.github.io/) on LMI-based control integration in neural networks.
I completed my Ph.D. at LAAS–CNRS under the supervision of [Isabelle Queinnec](https://homepages.laas.fr/queinnec/) and [Luca Zaccarian](https://homepages.laas.fr/lzaccari/), studying control of resonant converters, with experimental work in collaboration with [Carlos Olalla](https://usuaris.tinet.cat/com.ea/) and [Luis Martínez-Salamero](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=71pwBGoAAAAJ) at URV (Spain).
My research interests include mechatronics, power electronics, control, and robotics, with a strong focus on practical implementation and hardware validation.
