The most part of my thesis (and also master work) is dedicated to the modeling and control of resonant converters.
We choose the Hybrid Systems framework for the modeling and state-plane-based control laws for the controller.
The controller is implemented into an FPGA in order to test it on a prototype of SRC and LLC.

In [this link](https://nzaupa.github.io/FPGA_resonant_converter/intro.html) you can find a page under construction with the aim of explaining what was done during this project.
The idea is that it is going to contain all the work described in my PhD thesis. Ideally, I will take the time to move from the pdf to online so that it is more accessible.
